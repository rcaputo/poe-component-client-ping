Revision history for POE::Component::Client::Ping
=================================================

Changes marked with "(!!!)" may break backward compatibility.  Changes
marked with "(???)" are just information.

Note to self: Don't forget to tag the version after a new distribution
is released.  For example: `cvs tag -Rc v1_00 .'

---------------
0.92 2001.05.29
---------------

Removed private subnet addresses from t/01_ping.t.  My FreeBSD 4.3
system is set up to deny ICMP pings to subnets, and I imagine others
also are.

---------------
0.91 2000.09.02
---------------

On crysflame's recommendation, I moved the Ping.pm file out of
POE/Component/Client and added a PM directive to Makefile.PL.  Now
Ping.pm gets installed.  Fixed the MANIFEST and cleaned up Makefile.PL
a little while I was in there.

---------------
0.90 2000.08.29
---------------

Initial release.  Arbitrarily versioned at 0.90 to indicate pretty
good stability but the need for some beta testing.

Extracted the "Pinger" component code from poing, cleaned it up,
redesigned the interface so several sessions can request multiple
simultaneous pings from a single Ping component, commented the code,
documented it, and made it a module.
