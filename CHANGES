Revision history for POE::Component::Client::Ping
=================================================

Changes marked with "(!!!)" may break backward compatibility.  Changes
marked with "(???)" are just information.

Note to self: Don't forget to tag the version after a new distribution
is released.  For example: `cvs tag -Rc v1_00 .'

Michael Ching discovered that the component would ping 127.0.0.1 if
given an invalid address.  Rocco applied his patch to fail outright in
this case.  Also his patch to make the SYNOPSIS work.

Michael Ching also pointed out that send() failing should count for
something other than a harsh, unexplained die().  I adapted his code
from the previous patch to gracefully indicate ping failure when
send() fails.

L. Leo found a typo in poco_ping_ping().  I'm surprised it wasn't
causing noticeable problems.

Michael Ching added constants for the fields in Client::Ping's
responses.  This is nicer than relying on their order.

Michael Ching also added a OneReply parameter, which should speed up
Client::Ping when you know you're pinging individual hosts.  OneReply
short-circuits the timeout wait, returning at most one reply from any
request.

Michael Ching added a feature where, if the response event is an ARRAY
reference, the first element is the event and the remainder are user
arguments.  These user arguments are passed back in the component's
response.

Michael Ching noticed that this component traps all signals.  Now that
POE's signal handling semantics are being fixed, this type of trapping
causes programs to never exit.  Michael updated the signal handler to
work correctly now.

Michael Ching also documented his patches.  Excellent!

---------------
0.95 2001.11.18
---------------

Add the changes for 0.94, which were forgotten in 0.94.  Whoops!

Add Fletch's patch to accept a pre-built raw socket.  It's possible to
create a raw socket, drop down to regular user privileges, and *then*
start pinging.

---------------
0.94 2001.10.15
---------------

Fix an off-by-one error in t/01_ping.t that was causing false
failures.

---------------
0.93 2001.10.13
---------------

Fix a copy-and-paste-o in the documentation.  I had copied it from
POE::Component::Client::DNS, and the docs had a lingering instance of
that module name.  Thanks for spotting this, Fletch.

Documented undefined response addresses.  They're markers that a ping
request has timed out and won't be generating more responses.

---------------
0.92 2001.05.29
---------------

Removed private subnet addresses from t/01_ping.t.  My FreeBSD 4.3
system is set up to deny ICMP pings to subnets, and I imagine others
also are.

---------------
0.91 2000.09.02
---------------

On crysflame's recommendation, I moved the Ping.pm file out of
POE/Component/Client and added a PM directive to Makefile.PL.  Now
Ping.pm gets installed.  Fixed the MANIFEST and cleaned up Makefile.PL
a little while I was in there.

---------------
0.90 2000.08.29
---------------

Initial release.  Arbitrarily versioned at 0.90 to indicate pretty
good stability but the need for some beta testing.

Extracted the "Pinger" component code from poing, cleaned it up,
redesigned the interface so several sessions can request multiple
simultaneous pings from a single Ping component, commented the code,
documented it, and made it a module.
